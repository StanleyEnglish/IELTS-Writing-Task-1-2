### Exemplar 1: Process Diagram
**Prompt:** The diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

**Essay:**
The diagram compares two different tools from the Stone Age. Overall, the later tool is significantly larger, sharper and much more refined than the old version.

Looking first at the front view, Tool A, which dates back 1.4 million years, measures approximately seven to eight centimeters in length and has an irregular surface with uneven, jagged edges. It is blunter at the tip and narrower at the base. In contrast, Tool B, made 0.8 million years ago, is slightly longer, around ten centimeters in length, but shows a much smoother finish. It is sharper at the top, broader at the bottom and has a defined teardrop shape.

From the side view, the newer tool is thinner, has a sharper tip and a noticeably smoother surface, whereas the older one appears thicker, unevenly chipped and more roughly shaped.

From the back view, Tool B is much larger, broader and closely mirrors the front side, while Tool A looks asymmetrical and less refined with rough edges and irregular contours.

### Exemplar 2: Table
**Prompt:** The table below compares data for the world’s large-scale and small-scale sea fishing industries. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

**Essay:**
The table compares two types of fishing industries across various categories.

Overall, large-scale industrial ships surpass their small-scale counterparts in most aspects, except for employment, as there are far more workers on fishing boats than on large ships.

Looking first at employment, 120 million people work on small-scale fishing boat, 240 times higher than the number of workers on industrial ships. However, annual pay for each employee on fishing boats is much lower, ranging from $200 to $3,000 compared to $25,000 to $350,000 earned by those working on large ships.

Regarding annual catch for food, there is no significant difference between the two industries, with industrial ships contributing 29 million tonnes and small boats 24 million tonnes. However, there is a marked contrast in the amount used for industrial processing. While big vessels provide 22 million tonnes, their small-scale counterparts contribute almost none.

Finally, there is also a striking difference in fuel consumption. Small fishing boats consume 8,500 gallons annually, which is significantly lower than the 65,000 gallons used by large ships.

### Exemplar 3: Map
**Prompt:** The maps below show a part of a village in 1910 and the same part of the village in 2010. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

**Essay:**
The two maps depict a section of a village called Shalton in 1910 and how it looked a century later.

Overall, the most striking transformation was the removal of green spaces and the addition of several commercial and residential areas.

In 1910, this section of the village was bordered by three major roads: School Road to the west, London Road to the east, and High Street to the south, which together formed a triangular layout. At the heart of the village stood a large house surrounded by trees, and directly to its south were a grocer, a small house, and a baker. Several houses were located on High Street, whereas along School Road, there was a school, a butcher, and another house. A post office stood at the corner of School Road and London Road.

By 2010, the most significant change was the disappearance of the large house and its surrounding greenery to make way for a new residential area, accessed via a side road branching off from London Road. The grocer had been converted into a café, while the baker had been removed. A new supermarket with an adjoining parking lot had occupied the area where the butcher once stood. In addition, the house to the north of School Road had been replaced by a bank, while the post office opposite it and the school in the southwest remained unchanged. Meanwhile, a number of houses had been constructed along London Road and High Street.

### Exemplar 4: Line Graph
**Prompt:** The line graph below shows the percentage of workers from five different European countries that were absent for a day or more due to illness from 1991 to 2001. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

**Essay:**
The line graph compares the proportion of employees who took at least a day of sick leave in five European nations between 1991 and 2001.

Overall, levels of sickness absence in the Netherlands and Sweden showed a general upward trend, while France’s rate declined significantly throughout the period. Meanwhile, the UK and Germany recorded the lowest, but most stable, figures.

In the Netherlands, illness absence rates were the highest in all years , except 1991, when the rate was around 4.9%, slightly below France’s 5%. This rate then increased to a peak of roughly 5.5% in 1992 before falling sharply to a low of about 4% in 1996. From there, it quickly climbed back to its earlier peak by 2001.

France and Sweden experienced contrasting trends. In 1991, France recorded the highest absence rate at 5%, while Sweden’s rate was lower, at only 3%. France’s figures then decreased significantly and were surpassed by Sweden’s in 1996 before stabilizing at close to 3% for the rest of the period. By contrast, after hovering at roughly 3% for the first six years, Sweden’s figures increased dramatically, ending the period at nearly 4.8%.

Turning to the remaining nations, sickness absence levels in Germany were the lowest among the five, fluctuating around 1.5% over the decade. The UK’s figures also remained relatively stable, but were slightly higher, at roughly 2.5%.

### Exemplar 5: Bar Chart
**Prompt:** The bar chart below shows the results of a survey about people’s coffee and tea buying and drinking habits in five Australian cities. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

**Essay:**
The bar chart compares the percentages of people living in five Australian cities who bought and drank two types of beverages, tea and coffee, during the last four weeks.

Overall, the majority of people in all these cities went to a café for coffee or tea, except residents of Adelaide, who were more likely to buy instant coffee to visiting a coffee shop. Of the three categories, buying fresh coffee was the least common.

More than 60% of those living in Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart drank tea or coffee at a café, followed by Brisbane with 55% and Adelaide with just under 50%. Adelaide was the only city where buying instant coffee was more common than visiting a café, with nearly half of its residents purchasing instant coffee. Roughly 53% of urban dwellers in Hobart and Brisbane bought this product in the last four weeks, while the figures for Melbourne and Sydney were slightly lower, at around 47% and little above 45% respectively.

Turning to the remaining category, the proportions of people in Sydney and Melbourne who bought fresh coffee were roughly similar, at about 43% each, and in Hobart it was approximately 37%. This product was the least common in the other two cities, where it was purchased by only around 34% of the total residents.

### Exemplar 6: Pie Chart
**Prompt:** The pie charts show the percentage of people working in different sectors in town A and B in two years, 1960 and 2010. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

**Essay:**
The four pie charts compare the distribution of employment in three different sectors in town A and town B in 1960 and 2010.

Overall, town A saw the greatest increase in the percentage of people working in the manufacturing sector, which overtook the other sectors to employ most of the workers of the town. In town B, however, sales had the highest proportion of the workforce.

Looking at town A, we can see that in 1960, 40% of the employees in town A had a sales-related job, while the figures for manufacturing and services were lower, at 30% and 29%, respectively. In 2010, however, manufacturing surpassed the other two sectors to attract the highest proportion of workers (64%), whereas employment in sales and services saw a decline of 21% and 14%, respectively.

Turning to town B, sales attracted the majority of people, despite a drop from 70% in 1960 to 53% in 2010. Manufacturing and services, by contrast, saw rises in the proportion of employees of 15% and 2%, respectively.

### Exemplar 1: Two-part question
**Prompt:** Nowadays, many people use the Internet to get medical advice instead of going to see a doctor. Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?

**Essay:**
These days, an increasing number of people rely on the Internet for medical advice instead of consulting qualified healthcare professionals. The major reasons behind this trend are cost-effectiveness and convenience, but I believe that this is an overall negative development.

One of the most significant factors driving many people to seek medical guidance online is financial considerations. The cost of healthcare has dramatically increased in recent years, making it a heavy burden for many households. A general medical checkup in Vietnam, for example, may cost around one million VND, equivalent to roughly one fifth of an average worker’s monthly salary. Consequently, many resort to medical blogs or social media platforms as a cheaper alternative for finding medical tips and remedies. Another factor is convenience. In today’s digitally interconnected world, with just a few clicks, users can gain immediate access to information about symptoms, illnesses, and treatments without the need to book appointments or physically travel to a hospital or clinic.

Despite these apparent benefits, I consider this practice problematic because of the widespread dissemination of misleading information and the potential health risks involved. For example, some cancer patients have rejected professional medical treatments after joining Facebook groups promoting natural remedies, such as herbal medicines. These groups often falsely claim that all cancers can be entirely cured by natural therapies. Adopting advice that lacks scientific validation and supervision from professional medical practitioners can put people’s health at risk. Extreme diets and prolonged fasting for weight loss purposes, for instance, have led many people to suffer from eating disorders, digestive complications, and dangerously low blood pressure.

In conclusion, people increasingly turn to online resources for medical advice because of their affordability and convenience. However, given the widespread misinformation and potentially harmful, unverified practices online, I am convinced that this is a negative trend.

### Exemplar 2: Agree or disagree
**Prompt:** Some people think that traditional games are better than modern games in helping children develop their abilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

**Essay:**
Some people argue that traditional games offer greater benefits than modern alternatives in developing children’s skills. I completely agree with this view, as traditional games are better at promoting physical activity and nurturing essential social abilities.

One of the most significant benefits of traditional games is their contribution to children’s physical health. Classic activities, such as hide and seek, jump rope, and rock climbing, require movement, functioning as a form of exercise that improves stamina, respiratory health, and overall fitness levels. Modern games, on the other hand, encourage a sedentary lifestyle, as they often involve screen time and minimal physical activity. Children who spend an excessive number of hours playing video games, for example, are more likely to develop health issues, such as obesity, eye strain, or posture-related problems, whereas those who engage in traditional games benefit from regular physical exertion.

Another compelling advantage of traditional games is their ability to enhance social skills. These activities typically require face-to-face communication and teamwork, providing children with valuable opportunities to develop important skills, such as problem-solving, negotiation, and conflict resolution abilities. Games like Minefield, a team-building game, for instance, teach players how to collaborate effectively and prioritize collective success over individual gain. These skills are crucial in preparing children to navigate real-world challenges and adapt seamlessly to adulthood. Modern games, in contrast, often involve solitary gameplay in virtual settings, limiting direct human engagement and offering little scope for the development of interpersonal skills.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that traditional games are more beneficial than modern ones, as they actively promote children’s physical well-being and cultivate vital social skills.

### Exemplar 3: Discussion
**Prompt:** Some people argue that job satisfaction is more important than job security, while others believe that they cannot always expect job satisfaction, and a permanent job is more important. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

**Essay:**
It is argued by some that job security is not as important as how satisfied we feel with what we do, whereas others believe that we should do a job that frees us from unemployment stress and ensures we have a stable income. I am personally in favour of the viewpoint of the first group.

People who like the idea of doing a permanent job say that, in today’s cut-throat labour market where thousands of new graduates face unemployment annually, staying in the same job is a much safer choice than switching jobs to find job satisfaction. The combination of the increasingly competitive job market and the rising cost of living means that job security has become the most important consideration for job seekers. Many people experience temporary unemployment after quitting their previous jobs to look for new ones that offer a higher level of job satisfaction. For those who are primary breadwinners, this is a risky decision.

Despite the above arguments, I feel that we should never stop looking for jobs that make us happy and fulfilled. I personally believe that no matter how competitive the labour market is, there are always enough jobs for everyone. Spending several months or even a year seeking a rewarding job is much better than spending a lifetime stuck in a job that we are reluctant to do just because it is safe and stable. My grandfather, for example, has always regretted not following the photography career that he would have loved to have had; instead, he chose to be a teacher because of a stable monthly paycheck.

In conclusion, although some argue that a secure job is more important than a satisfying job, I am of the opinion that we should always look for a job that brings us happiness and fulfilment rather than stability.

### Exemplar 4: Advantages and disadvantages
**Prompt:** The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?

**Essay:**
These days, face-to-face communication is being replaced with online conversations using social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp or Tumblr. It seems to me that the benefits these technologies have brought to our lives are overshadowed by their drawbacks.

In terms of the advantages, social networking sites have made it much easier for us to keep in contact with our loved ones, regardless of geographic location. Students studying abroad, for example, can keep in touch with their families and friends on a daily basis using the video call features of Skype, Facebook or various other apps. Social media is also a powerful tool in marketing and business. In this digital age, companies can keep their clients updated regarding newly-released products or promotions by posting their campaigns on Facebook or Instagram, which helps save a great deal of time and expense compared to the traditional methods of advertising in newspapers or magazines.

Despite the above benefits, I personally believe that when it comes to communication, social media does more harm than good. The overuse of social media reduces the quality of interpersonal communication. Many people are so addicted to social networking sites that they constantly stare at their screens during dinners with their families without actually paying attention to the people around them. The frequent use of social media also affects the style of speaking and writing, especially among young people. These days, many teenagers have a habit of using abbreviated words, which are frequently used in text messages or in posts on social media, in their academic essays or formal emails.

In conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, I am of the opinion that the positive effects that social media has on our communication are outweighed by the disadvantages.

### Exemplar 5: Causes and solutions
**Prompt:** People are consuming more and more sugar-based drinks. Why? What can be done to reduce sugary drink consumption?

**Essay:**
The consumption of sugary drinks has significantly increased in recent years. The highly addictive ingredients in these beverages are the major reason for this, and several measures can be implemented to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage intake.

In terms of the principal reason behind the rise in sugar-based drink consumption, sugar and caffeine – the two most addictive properties found in most sugary beverages – are the main culprits. These substances give people an instant energy boost to help them focus more effectively on their work, but they also cause a drop in energy quickly after consumption so that they have to drink another one to get an extra boost. In addition, sugar is so addictive that many people find it impossible to quit consuming soft drinks or other sugar-based beverages. Those who stop drinking beverages with added sugar or other sweeteners for a short period of time might experience some common withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, tiredness or poor concentration.

A number of approaches can be taken to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks. A tax on such products might be an effective solution as people might think twice before buying a coke or a soda, for example. Another measure would be to limit advertisements promoting sugar-sweetened drinks that are directly targeted at children and young people. Instead, there should be more programmes, billboards and posters that educate on healthy eating and the health risks associated with the excessive consumption of sugar-based beverages.

In conclusion, the addiction caused by some properties in sugary drinks is the primary reason why more and more people are consuming such products. Despite this, there are various actions that can be taken to discourage people from drinking sugary beverages.

### Exemplar 6: Problems and solutions
**Prompt:** Today, TV channels provide men’s sport shows more than women’s sport shows. Why? Should TV channels give equal time for women’s sport and men’s sport?

**Essay:**
These days, when it comes to sport, a higher number of games played by men are broadcast, compared to that of women. A growing number of people having more interest in men’s sporting events is the main reason for this and I believe that equal attention should be paid to women’s sport.

The major factor leading television producers to prioritise men’s sport is the audience watching male athletes competing considerably outnumbers people watching shows of their female counterparts. More viewers mean more profits, advertising contracts and sponsorship investments for the TV channels broadcasting the shows. Take football in Vietnam as an example. Men’s football match at the 30th SEA games attracted millions of people both from different parts of Vietnam and other neighbouring countries, while the figure for women’s match was significantly lower. Giving men’s sport a higher priority is, therefore, a wise strategy to earn large profits and attract more investment.

However, I would argue that TV coverage should not be biased towards men’s sport and that female athletes should be given equal opportunities. If men’s sports programmes continue to receive significantly more coverage than the programmes of their opposite sex, it might increase gender inequality, which is one of the most serious issues in many parts of the world today. Another thing is that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who have interest in women’s sport in recent years, and hence, television coverage should focus more on this area.

In conclusion, a wider audience watching men’s sports channels is the most important reason why TV producers provide more men’s shows than women’s shows, and I am of the opinion that there should be a greater equality in the coverage of men’s and women’s sport.

### Exemplar 7: Problems and solutions
**Prompt:** In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of aging populations.

**Essay:**
Many developed countries are experiencing substantial increases in life expectancy. This essay will highlight some of the main problems of this and suggest several possible approaches to reduce the adverse effects resulting from an ageing population.

One of the major challenges of the growing population of elderly people is that it puts a heavy burden on the healthcare system. Older people are more vulnerable to chronic diseases, such as heart attacks or diabetes, that require special medical treatments to be effectively treated. The government might have to devote a larger budget to healthcare in order to serve the growing demands of an ageing population. Another problem facing a country with increasing life expectancy is that there will be an increase in the proportion of retired people claiming pension benefits, and a decline in the percentage of people of working age who pay income taxes. The combination of higher pension spending and lower tax revenues can seriously affect government spending and the economy as a whole.

The government could implement a range of measures to deal with the problems of increasing life expectancy. The first solution would be to increase the importance of the private sector in providing healthcare and pensions. This would help reduce the burden on government spending. Another measure would be to encourage the immigration of young working adults, which could help increase tax revenues for the government. Finally, it is important to educate people about the importance of money management and saving for retirement. By doing this, when people reach their retirement age, they will have a certain amount of money to take care of themselves without the need to depend on their children or the government.

In conclusion, various steps could be taken to tackle the problems that a country with an ageing population might encounter.

### Exemplar 8: Positive or negative development
**Prompt:** In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, rather than in large family groups. Is this a positive or negative trend?

**Essay:**
The number of people opting to reside in small apartments by themselves has been steadily increasing. While some argue that the disadvantages of this trend outweigh its merits, I firmly believe that it is a positive development as it signifies positive personal growth and economic development.

Living alone or with a small family allows individuals to experience greater freedom and personal space. It becomes more convenient for them to engage in their passions and hobbies outside of work without being accountable to extended family members. In a nuclear family, which is small by nature, responsibilities are divided and assigned, enabling family members to dedicate more time to pursuing their interests. Furthermore, when living independently, individuals do not have to concern themselves with the opinions or responsibilities of other family members. This provides them with additional time for reflection and self-improvement, which is crucial for personal growth.

Moreover, economic stability plays a significant role in the decision to live in a small family or independently. It is notably easier to manage financial responsibilities when living alone or with a partner and only one child. This allows for better financial planning, as it can provide a higher quality of life for their children and savings for emergencies. Additionally, living independently encourages individuals to develop essential life skills such as personal financial management, household chores, cooking, and shopping. Independent living also means not having to provide for other family members continually, which helps avoid excessive expenses.

In conclusion, I am confident that the trend toward smaller households and independent living is beneficial for society as a whole. It offers increased personal space and freedom, along with financial advantages and valuable life skills.

### Exemplar 9: Advantages outweigh disadvantages
**Prompt:** Many parents choose to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the benefits of homeschooling outweigh its drawbacks?

**Essay:**
In this day and age, an increasing number of parents prefer home-schooling their children to enrolling them in traditional schools. While there are certain benefits to this trend, I believe it is a net negative.

Proponents of this shift might argue that teaching at home would enable better supervision. Through one-on-one learning, parents can support children more easily and immediately, including identifying their weaknesses and strengths, potentially tailoring a more personalized and effective academic plan for these individuals. Another viable argument is that this way of education may create a stress-free learning environment, allowing children to comfortably learn at their own pace without the constant urge to keep up with peers in normal classes. As a result, homeschooling can hopefully alleviate mental complications like peer pressure, grades obsession, and depression, which primarily stem from academic pressure at schools. This approach may be especially suitable for mentally vulnerable or autistic students, who learn better with detailed guidance and specialized care.

However, despite the aforementioned merits, I am convinced that the drawbacks of this trend are more pronounced. The foremost reason is that parent-led education can gradually fuel a sense of overdependence. While home-schooling may offer better personal guidance, children are likely to become reluctant to find solutions themselves without the help of adults. This passivity would, in turn, erode their decision-making skills, negatively affecting such individuals later in life. My argument is further bolstered by the fact that this educational model can undermine children’s interpersonal skills. Traditional schools offer a wide range of networking opportunities with teachers, peers and seniors. Such relationships not only help students become more sociable, but are also valuable in terms of finding future career prospects or advice during hardships. This is not found in home-schooling, where children mostly interact with parents, hindering their chances for network expansion. This limitation ultimately creates obstacles for children to integrate with their peers in adulthood, potentially restricting future job opportunities.

In conclusion, notwithstanding certain desirable outcomes that home-education brings, I firmly believe that they pale in comparison with the disadvantages of this teaching approach.

### Exemplar 10: Agree or disagree
**Prompt:** Modern technology is forming a single world culture. Do you agree or disagree?

**Essay:**
The accelerating march of technology has shrunk distances and blurred cultural borders to such an extent that societies now resemble one another in unprecedented ways. I fully agree that modern technology is creating a single global culture. This essay will argue that the dominance of global digital platforms has unified lifestyles across countries, and that technological standardisation in communication and consumption has erased many traditional distinctions.

The first major force behind cultural convergence is the overwhelming dominance of digital platforms that dictate how people worldwide spend their time. Social media giants, search engines, and streaming services spread uniform tastes, slang, and humour across borders. Young adults in vastly different geographies now laugh at the same viral memes, follow the same influencers, and adapt their fashion or speech to mirror global icons. Even political movements are staged in a similar digital style, with hashtags, livestreams, and orchestrated visuals. The homogenisation is not accidental; algorithms reward universal relatability and discourage regional eccentricities. As a result, national cultures are increasingly subordinate to the aesthetic and behavioural codes dictated by a handful of technological ecosystems. A teenager in São Paulo and another in Seoul are not simply connected—they are culturally synchronised through a shared digital diet.

Equally significant is the way technology standardises consumption, communication, and even social rituals. Online marketplaces promote the same global brands, while fast-delivery apps spread identical eating patterns, from pizzas to bubble tea. Video calls, emojis, and instant messaging have compressed communication styles into concise, image-driven formats that transcend linguistic nuance but flatten expression. Religious festivals are broadcast on YouTube, weddings are live-streamed on Instagram, and global holidays like Black Friday overshadow indigenous calendars. Traditional markers of difference—local dress, cuisine, dialects—are increasingly repackaged into commodified versions for tourist appeal, while the daily lives of urban populations follow near-identical rhythms mediated by smartphones and cloud platforms. In effect, technology not only transports culture but scripts it into predictable forms.

In conclusion, the evidence demonstrates that technology has become the architect of a single world culture by shaping what people watch, how they speak, and the ways they live. Through digital platforms and standardised practices, once-distinct societies are now harmonised into a uniform global lifestyle that transcends geography.

### Exemplar Band 6.0
**Prompt:** Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extend do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?

**Essay:**
Air pollution is a worldwide concerned issue, because it influences the safety of human living. In addition, traffic jam is another big issue having negative impact on the happyness of life. There are different ways to resolve the problems, such as limited car use, restricting the waste products from the industry, and the increased petrol price. This article will discuss the reason why the increased price of petrol is not the most effective way to resolve the issue and other ways help release the traffic and pollution issue.

First of all, just solely increasing the cost in petrol is not the most effective method to resolve the traffic and pollution issue. This is because people may not cease using a car just because the price is higher than before, comparing with the poor and expensive public transportation. For example, in Australia, people need to spend eight AUD for one day traffic. If the people does not have a long journey, they may not choose taking public transport, because public transport is more expensive and unconvenient for them compared with using privaite cars. As a result, just increasing the petrol fee would not be the best way to control the car use, and then it would not accomplish the aim.

However, if government could use the multiple methods to control the issue, such as by educating, media spreading, increasing the price and increasing the age of the drivers. It may be more effective because the different combination ways are aiming to different groups to control the use of car. For example, to increase the age requirement for the drivers can restrict the young generation to use the private car. By spreading the traffic and pollution problem by television will be useful for the groups who generally watch televisions. Therefore, it would be more effective to accomplish the aim of traffic and pollution control.

In conclusion, the effective way to control the traffic and pollution issue is not solely focusing on increasing the cost of petrol, because the effectiveness depends on different public transport situations, however, the combination ways may be more effective to resolve the problem.

**Examiner Commentary (Band 6.0):**
- **TR:** The test taker presents ideas that support both parts of the prompt and there is a clear position. The response focuses more on dealing with traffic problems than pollution problems and this prevents a higher rating as some parts of the prompt are more fully covered than others.
- **CC:** The progression of ideas is logical throughout and paragraphing is very clear. A range of cohesive devices are used, and substitution and referencing are generally well managed. The range presented and the clear overall progression of ideas means the positive features of a Band 7 are met.
- **LR:** The test taker attempts to use a wider range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision. There are some good examples of appropriate collocation and some lower frequency lexis. However, more than occasional errors are made in word choice and spelling, and this limits the rating to a Band 6.
- **GRA:** A mix of simple and complex sentence structures are used but errors in grammar and punctuation occur and indicate limitations in control.

### Exemplar Band 7.0
**Prompt:** Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extend do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?

**Essay:**
The growing traffic and pollution problems bring a lot of negative influences for people. Some people think that increasing the price of petrol is a good way to solve these problems. I believe that to control the price of petrol can reduce traffic congestion and air pollution to a certain extent, but it is not the best way and cannot thoroughly solve these problems.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that traffic jam and air pollution will be improved when petrol becomes more expensive. In this case, people can reduce to use their private cars. Many people may take public transportation to travel, which means gas emission will be decreased and the number of cars which are driven on the way become lower. At the same time, raising the cost of petrol can help reduce the environmental impact of the airline industry because the price of the air ticket will be increased. Higher prices have discouraged people from traveling great distances to other places. Greenhouse gases produced by airplanes can decrease if the number of air flight drops.

However, increasing the price of petrol is not the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. Traffic congestion and pollution problems are complex problems include overpopulation, low technology etc. These problems can be easily solved when science and technology are improved higher. For example, people can explore more space to immigration, or install gas purifier on the automobile exhaust pipe. Governments can control the number of population to prevent traffic jam and population conditions. There are more methods to solve these problems.

Overall, controlling the price of petrol can reduce traffic congestion and air pollution to a certain extent, but it is not the best way and cannot thoroughly solve these problems. More solutions can be taken to solve them, such as high-technology and controlling the number of population.

**Examiner Commentary (Band 7.0):**
- **TR:** The writer addresses both aspects of the task and presents a clear position throughout the response. Main ideas are generally clear, though the second part of the prompt could have more supporting detail.
- **CC:** Ideas are generally well organised and there is a clear overall progression. A range of cohesive devices is used effectively, but there is some underuse and a tendency to place the linker at the beginning of sentences.
- **LR:** A sufficient range of vocabulary is used with some flexibility and there are examples of less common lexical items and appropriate collocation. There are some awkward expressions or inappropriacies in word choice, but they do not limit the rating for this criterion.
- **GRA:** A variety of complex structures is used with some accuracy. Punctuation is generally well controlled and errors do not impede communication.
